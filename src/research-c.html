            <h3>ABOUT UNIVERSITY OF HARGEISA RESEARCH AND COMMUNITY SERVICE

            </h3>
            <h5>
                The University which is currently the biggest and leading national institution of higher learning in Somaliland, has the mandate bestowed upon it by the law to conduct research, disseminate and publish research outputs and innovations, and provide community services. Since its inception, the university has been active in the teaching-learning process, however, the university was not strongly engaged in research and knowledge transfer. To this effect the contribution of the university in national development was minimal. In 2016 the University has established a directorate for research and community service in order to fill this gap. To feel the gap, the office of research and community service has taken the initiative to both improve the research culture and output as well as serve the local community.

Funding is strictly based on thematic and priority areas for research. The following guiding principles are used in priority setting of research:
